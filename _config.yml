I have five years of experience leading technical and industrial projects that relied on data to ensure their systems' success. I love finding new and useful ways to understand data.

I created visualizations and reports from performance data at BNSF's rail yards across the US. I used this data to optimize performance. As an engineer, I know firsthand the power of useful data to make substantial improvements on operations.

Most recently, I was Project Manager at Siemens, where I directed teams of engineers, technicians, and electricians to implement smart building control systems in the Portland, OR area.<br>
